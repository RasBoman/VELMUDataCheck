# VELMUDataCheck
These scripts are made to wrangle and check VELMU-data (underwater vegetation survey data). These source files are in excel-form, 
which are filled by 20+ surveyors. This means that the errors that might occur vary significantly. 
Basically the quality check consists of 

a) searching for typos (Ulca sp. instead pf Ulva sp...) 
b) searching for methodological errors (cm instead of meters).
c) Searching for outliers (whether they're real observations or errors)
d) Errors in locations or directions.  

To be added 2020

a) Biological validification. Whether a species is expected to grow on bottom type X or in the region.

These scripts are being constantly improved.
